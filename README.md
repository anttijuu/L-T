# Demos and samples

For a basic course on computers. 

The demonstrations illustrate certain aspects of how computers work.

Contents:

* `asm-helloworld` -- a simple hello world app in assembly on macOS.
* `double-rounding` -- examples in C of situations where rounding errors of floating point numbers cause problems. Languages include C, Java and Swift.
* `divbyzero` -- division by zero error:
  * `divbyzero.c` -- C example, shows how app crashes if number is divided by zero.
* `overflow` -- several examples of overflow happening with integers in different languages.
  * `main.c` -- shows how integer overflow happens with C language.
  * `main.swift` -- the same as above but with Swift programming language. 
  * `overflow.c` -- overflow with eight byte numbers in C.
  * `overflow.swift` -- overflow with eight byte numbers in Swift.
* `printformat` -- printing out numbers in different formats.
  * `numbinary.c` -- printing out long integers as bits.
  * `printformat.c` -- printint out an integer in different formats, char, unsigned, hex,...
* `shifting` -- examples of bit shifting operations on integers.
  * `shifting.c` -- a simple example of bit shifting.
  * `even-shift.c` -- shows how division and multiplication with even numbers can be done with bit shifting.
* `fun` -- fun examples :)
  * `spooky.swift` -- an example on how modern programming languages allow using almost any symbols in variable and function names, as well as values -- even emojis!
  * `x-or-fun
